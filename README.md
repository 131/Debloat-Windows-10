# Debloat Windows 10

This project is an effort to collect scripts which help *debloating* Windows
10.

I personally find the state Windows 10 comes in quite shocking / scary and want
to have very slim, scriptable solution to remove and disable Windows 10's
features most people do not need nor want.

The scripts provided consists of Powershell scripts, you should have no
problems altering and using them to fit your needs. Do not forget to set the
execution policy for Powershell scripts. And of course, how have to run them
with administrative priveledges.

    PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Look at the scripts most of them are only a couple of lines long and it should
be pretty obvious what they are doing.

## Contribute

I would be happy to extend the collection of scripts. Just open an issue or
send me a pull request.
